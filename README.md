#Description:

##Overview:
A web-application displaying stats and other goddies to players in the World of Tanks Community. Based on retrieving stats and data from API's provided by other awesome ppl and by Wargaming. the site currently residing at <http://saywotstats.net> is A HTML 5 project based on much jQuery and AJAX. The application is written with methods based mainly as custom created jQuery plugins.

###API Structure
The current project is using unoffical api 2.0 as described by thunder-spb <https://github.com/thunder-spb/wot-api-description>. Also using some data provided by vBAddict <http://www.vbaddict.net/wot.php> for the WN8 calculations.

###Metrics
Currently there are a number of different aggregated stats that are shown.
Some metrics involves: average damage, average frags, average spot, most played tank, WN7 and WN8 etc. Current release version 1.7. Which also involves give the user a possibility to save their searches in a cookie, making the application remember the users latest search when they return to <http://saywotstats.net>.

###History & Open source
It started as a fun project for my interest for the game and willingness to learn new stuff regarind IT-technology and API's. But a while back I decided I really wanted to put the code out to the public in case somebody found it useful and perhaps wanted to make [SayWotStats](http://saywotstats.net) better. So if anyone feels like they wanna use my ideas from the javascript front-end perspective feel free to do so (would appreciate a mention somewhere though ;)), or help make saywotstats better give me shout or something :).

P.s. I did save some of the old files in the project that used api 1.x. If you check out the wot_stats_functions_v1_backup.js file u will see the older jQuery plugins adjusted to api 1.x.

Peace to you all!
