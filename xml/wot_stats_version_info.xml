	<version_info>
		Currently using unofficial Wot API version 2.X
		Russian server working fully, rest is kind of mixed depending on the API not really serving correct data all the time (consistency guys, make it happen if u want devs to help u improve the community! ;)). V1.5 does show total statistics and statistics for the last 24 hours aswell as the last 1 weeks since the last server update (This might change in next version since the data from the recent time period seem to be unstable on some servers). 
		Maybe I'll get to work on wn8 or something else cool in the future if I got time and interest :).
